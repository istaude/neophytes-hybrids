# About

The R Code provided in this repository allows to reproduce the entire
data carpentry, analysis and visualization of *“Neophytes may promote
hybridization and adaptations to a changing planet”*.

POWO, GloNAF and human footprint data are publicly available at:

POWO:
<https://storage.googleapis.com/kew-dev-backup/world_checklist_names_and_distribution_feb_21.zip>

GloNAF: <https://idata.idiv.de/DDM/Data/ShowData/257>

Human footprint:
<https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/wildareas-v3-2009-human-footprint>

British Ordnance Survey national grid is available at:
<https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-British-National-Grids>

All data generated and used in this analysis are also available on
Google Drive at:

## Folder structure

The script structure in the `R-code` folder follows the figures in the
main text.

1.  `00` loads all packages

2.  `01` contains the code to test the spatial geographic overlap
    between hybrid and neophyte incidence.

3.  `01b` contains the code to quantify how often naturalizations meet
    congeners.

4.  `02` contains the code to check the taxonomic overlap between hybrid
    and neophyte incidence, and to visualize the phylogeny.

5.  `03` contains the code to compare diversification rates in genera
    with and without neophytes and hybrids.

6.  `04` contains the code to compare the geographic distribution of
    neophyte, native and hybrid in relation to the human footprint in
    the United Kingdom.
